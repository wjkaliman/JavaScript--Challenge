# JavaScript--Challenge
Create a basic HTML web page. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.  Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input. 
 Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape
